```

array      A fixed-size array, denoted [T; N], for the element type, T, and the non-negative compile-time constant size, N.
bool       The boolean type.
char       A character type.
f32        A 32-bit floating point type (specifically, the “binary32” type defined in IEEE 754-2008).
f64        A 64-bit floating point type (specifically, the “binary64” type defined in IEEE 754-2008).
fn         Function pointers, like fn(usize) -> bool.
i8         The 8-bit signed integer type.
i16        The 16-bit signed integer type.
i32        The 32-bit signed integer type.
i64         The 64-bit signed integer type.
i128        The 128-bit signed integer type.
isize       The pointer-sized signed integer type.
pointer    Raw, unsafe pointers, *const T, and *mut T.
reference  References, both shared and mutable.
slice      A dynamically-sized view into a contiguous sequence, [T]. Contiguous here means that elements are laid out so that every element is the same distance from its neighbors.
str        String slices.
tuple      A finite heterogeneous sequence, (T, U, ..).
u8         The 8-bit unsigned integer type.
u16        The 16-bit unsigned integer type.
u32        The 32-bit unsigned integer type.
u64        The 64-bit unsigned integer type.
u128       The 128-bit unsigned integer type.
unit       The () type, also called “unit”.
usize      The pointer-sized unsigned integer type.
